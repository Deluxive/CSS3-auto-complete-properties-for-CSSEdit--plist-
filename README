This is a .plist file for MacRabbit CSSEdit adding extra CSS auto-completion. 
The application hasen't been updated since August 2007 (which is a long time in this area).

However i, and many others are still using CSSEdit. Why? I find the UI to be the best of all CSS editors on the market. While MacRabbit released Espresso 2 with ”CSSEdit 3” integrated, i found out that the UI is not as intuitive as CSSEdit. Also some features are missing. 

Espresso is a great overall editor, but if you ask me (and a bunch of frustrated designers) the CSS part is not. 

The .plist is updated (and forked) from Jesse Dodds list at https://github.com/jessedodds/CSS3-auto-complete-properties-for-CSSEdit--plist-

To install, browse to CSSEdit.app, right-click and select ‘Show Package Contents’, navigate into ‘Resources’ within the ‘Contents’ folder and simply copy the AutoComplete.plist file. Select ‘Replace’ when prompted by Finder.

Mail MacRabbit (http://macrabbit.com/about/) and ask for a standalone version of CSSEdit. Or if you are a application developer (i'm looking at you Panic), consider to implement (or get inspired) the layout of CSSEdit in your app (Screenshot: http://bit.ly/YTL3zL)
