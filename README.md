# Extra CSS support for CSSEdit

## About
This is a `.plist` file for the Mac OS X Application ***CSSEdit by MacRabbit*** adding extra CSS auto-completion.   
The application was last updated  *August 2007* and has been dead and buried since then.

## But why?

Me and many others are <del>still using</del> *CSSEdit*. But why? The UI of *CSSEdit* is hard to beat. Other Editors is behind in terms of usability and speed. While *MacRabbit* released the General Code Editor *Espresso 2* with ”CSSEdit 3 integrated”,  it was a downgrade for CSS editing, both feature wise (in some aspects) and UI wise compared to *CSSEdit*. 

The .plist is updated (and forked) from Jesse Dodds repo [here](https://github.com/jessedodds/CSS3-auto-complete-properties-for-CSSEdit--plist-)
(For more info, visit Jesse Dodd's Blog: http://notes.jessedodds.com/post/613046962).

## Installation

1. [Download the .plist file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christopheranderton/CSS3-auto-complete-properties-for-CSSEdit--plist-/master/AutoCompletion.plist) 	
2. Go to the *CSSEdit.app* in the *Finder* then right-click and select *Show Package Contents*
3. Navigate to the folder *Resources* within the *Contents* folder 
4.  Just copy the `AutoCompletion.plist` file. Select **Replace** when asked if you wanna overwrite the existing file (make sure you do a backup first!).

## Year 2016 Status
I'm not using CSSEdit anymore. It was many years since, however, the UI still kicks ass. Still looking for a real replacement. Was looking into Atom or Brackets (that both are built on modern web technologies), but my knowledge for creating a Plug-in or Addon is sadly not up to pair for the task.
